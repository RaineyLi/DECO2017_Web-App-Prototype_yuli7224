                        <p> Time management is one of those skills that we’re not taught, but we develop with time and practice. It’s essential for success in many of life’s endeavours, including in the workplace and at business school. When we are good at managing our time, we are likely to have increased levels of productivity and lower levels of stress.
                          For postgraduate students, many of whom continue to work full-time while studying, effective time management is key to study success. One of the most important and universally used tools is a study planner, which, when used effectively, ......

                        <p>Time pressure is a type of psychological stress that occurs when a person has less time available (real or perceived) than is necessary to complete a task or obtain a result. When a consumer feels time pressure, they narrow their focus. They complete less research and compare less criteria. Let’s consider two scenarios. Low time pressure: You’re lying in bed one evening browsing on your tablet, and you decide you want a speaker for your patio.
